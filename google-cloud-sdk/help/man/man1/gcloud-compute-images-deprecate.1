.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBgcloud compute images deprecate\fR is used to deprecate images\&.
.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"
.PP
\fINAME\fR
.RS 4
The name of the image to set deprecation status of\&.
.RE
.SH "FLAGS"
.PP
\fB\-\-delete\-in\fR \fIDELETE_IN\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the amount of time until the image\(cqs status should be set to DELETED\&. For instance, specifying \(lq30d\(rq will set the status to DELETED in 30 days from the current system time\&. Valid units for this flag are \(lqs\(rq for seconds, \(lqm\(rq for minutes, \(lqh\(rq for hours and \(lqd\(rq for days\&. If no unit is specified, seconds is assumed\&.
.sp
Note that the image will not be deleted automatically\&. The image will only be marked as deleted\&. An explicit request to delete the image must be made in order to remove it from the image list\&. This flag is mutually exclusive with \-\-delete\-on\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-delete\-on\fR \fIDELETE_ON\fR
.RS 4
Similar to \-\-delete\-in, but specifies an absolute time when the status should be set to DELETED\&. The date and time specified must be a valid RFC 3339 full\-date or date\-time\&. For times in UTC, this looks like \(lqYYYY\-MM\-DDTHH:MM:SSZ\(rq\&. For example: 2020\-01\-02T00:00:00Z for midnight on January 2, 2020 in UTC\&. This flag is mutually exclusive with \-\-delete\-in\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-format\fR \fIFORMAT\fR
.RS 4
Specify a format for printed output\&. By default, a command\-specific human\-friendly output format is used\&. Setting this flag to one of the available options will serialize the result of the command in the chosen format and print it to stdout\&. Supported formats are: "json", "text", "yaml"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Display detailed help\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-obsolete\-in\fR \fIOBSOLETE_IN\fR
.RS 4
Specifies time (in the same format as \-\-delete\-in) until this image\(cqs status should become OBSOLETE\&. Obsolete images will cause an error whenever an attempt is made to apply the image to a new disk\&. This flag is mutually exclusive with \-\-obsolete\-on\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-obsolete\-on\fR \fIOBSOLETE_ON\fR
.RS 4
Specifies time (in the same format as \-\-delete\-on) when this image\(cqs status should become OBSOLETE\&. This flag is mutually exclusive with \-\-obsolete\-in\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-project\fR \fIPROJECT\fR
.RS 4
Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
.RS 4
Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands\&. If input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-replacement\fR \fIREPLACEMENT\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a Compute Engine image as a replacement for the image being phased out\&. Users of the deprecated image will be advised to switch to this replacement\&. For example, \(lq\-\-replacement my\-image\(rq or \(lq\-\-replacement projects/google/global/images/my\-image\(rq\&. This flag is required when setting the image state to anything other than \(lqACTIVE\(rq or when \-\-delete\-in, \-\-delete\-on, \-\-obsolete\-in, or \-\-obsolete\-on is provided\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-state\fR \fISTATE\fR
.RS 4
The deprecation state to set on the image\&. An image\(cqs default state is \(lqACTIVE\(rq, suggesting that the image is currently supported\&. Operations which create a new resource using a \(lqDEPRECATED\(rq image return successfully, but with a warning indicating that the image is deprecated and recommending its replacement\&. New uses of \(lqOBSOLETE\(rq or \(lqDELETED\(rq images result in an error\&. Note that setting the deprecation state to \(lqDELETED\(rq will not automatically delete the image\&. You must still make a request to delete the image to remove it from the image list\&.
