.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command is used to create a local workspace for your Google Cloud Platform project\&.
.sp
The local workspace is indicated by the creation of a [\&.gcloud] folder\&. In this folder is a file [properties] which allows you to override any global properties you may have set via the \fIgcloud config\fR command\&.
.sp
When you run a Cloud SDK command\-line tool from within this new workspace, it will use the new [properties] file as the first place to load properties\&. As a result, if you use gcloud, gcutil, gsutil, or any of the other commands in google\-cloud\-sdk/bin from within the workspace, they will connect to the correct project\&.
.sp
If you have enabled push\-to\-deploy in the Cloud Console, one of the things that \fIgcloud init\fR will do for you is cloning the Google\-hosted git repository associated with PROJECT\&. This repository will automatically be connected to Google, and it will use the credentials indicated as "active" by \fIgcloud auth list\fR\&. Pushing to the origin\(cqs "master" branch will trigger an App Engine deployment using the contents of that branch\&.
.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

.RS 4
The name of the Google Cloud Platform project that you want to use in a local workspace that will be created by this command\&. If this project has an associated Google\-hosted git repository, that repository will be cloned into the local workspace\&.
