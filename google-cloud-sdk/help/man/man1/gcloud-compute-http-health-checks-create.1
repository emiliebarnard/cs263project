.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBgcloud compute http\-health\-checks create\fR is used to create an HTTP health check\&. HTTP health checks monitor instances in a load balancer controlled by a target pool\&. All arguments to the command are optional except for the name of the health check\&. For more information on load balancing, see https://developers\&.google\&.com/compute/docs/load\-balancing/\&.
.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"
.PP
\fINAME\fR
.RS 4
The name of the HTTP health check\&.
.RE
.SH "FLAGS"
.PP
\fB\-\-check\-interval\fR \fICHECK_INTERVAL\fR
.RS 4
How often to perform a health check for an instance\&. For example, specifying \(lq10s\(rq will run the check every 10 seconds\&. Valid units for this flag are \(lqs\(rq for seconds, \(lqm\(rq for minutes, and \(lqh\(rq for hours\&. The default value is \(lq5s\(rq\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-description\fR \fIDESCRIPTION\fR
.RS 4
An optional, textual description for the HTTP health check\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-format\fR \fIFORMAT\fR
.RS 4
Specify a format for printed output\&. By default, a command\-specific human\-friendly output format is used\&. Setting this flag to one of the available options will serialize the result of the command in the chosen format and print it to stdout\&. Supported formats are: "json", "text", "yaml"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-healthy\-threshold\fR \fIHEALTHY_THRESHOLD\fR
.RS 4
The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy instance is marked as healthy\&. The default is 2\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Display detailed help\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-host\fR \fIHOST\fR
.RS 4
The value of the host header used in this HTTP health check request\&. By default, this is empty and Google Compute Engine automatically sets the host header in health requests to the same external IP address as the forwarding rule associated with the target pool\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-port\fR \fIPORT\fR
.RS 4
The TCP port number that this health check monitors\&. The default value is 80\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-project\fR \fIPROJECT\fR
.RS 4
Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
.RS 4
Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands\&. If input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-request\-path\fR \fIREQUEST_PATH\fR
.RS 4
The request path that this health check monitors\&. For example, \(lq/healthcheck\(rq\&. The default value is \(lq/\(rq\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-timeout\fR \fITIMEOUT\fR
.RS 4
If Google Compute Engine doesn\(cqt receive an HTTP 200 response from the instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the health check request is considered a failure\&. For example, specifying \(lq10s\(rq will cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a failure\&. Valid units for this flag are \(lqs\(rq for seconds, \(lqm\(rq for minutes, and \(lqh\(rq for hours\&. The default value is \(lq5s\(rq\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-unhealthy\-threshold\fR \fIUNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD\fR
.RS 4
The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy instance is marked as unhealthy\&. The default is 2\&.
